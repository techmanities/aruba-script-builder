When you do something for the first time, take notes and when finished quickly make a rough HOWTO document.

The second time you have to do a process, follow your rough notes and flesh out any details you may have missed.

The third time, ask someone who is not familiar with the process to follow your instructions. Invaluable feedback from fresh sets of eyes.

Fourth time, automate the process with code.

Fith time, press a button and watch your time investment pay dividends.
